ST ST25DV Discovery, MB1283 version
###################################

Overview
********

The ST25DV04K device is a dynamic NFC/RFID tag IC with a dual interface. It embeds a
4 Kbits EEPROM memory. It can be operated from an I2C interface, or by a 13.56 MHz
RFID reader, or by a NFC phone. The ST25DV04K Class 5 antenna daughter card, included
in the kit, can be replaced by Class 1 or Class 6 antennas.

The ST25DV-DISCOVERY is a demonstration kit to evaluate the features and capabilities
of the ST25DV series.
It is based on the NFC ST25DV04K device embedded on a daughter card using a Class 5 antenna
and a STM32 processor driving a mother board.

Serial Port
===========

The STM25DV Discovery kit has up to 8 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART1
which connected to the onboard ST-LINK/V2 Virtual COM port interface. Default communication
settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f769i_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM25DV Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to STM25DV Discovery
-------------------------------------------

First, connect the STM25DV Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm25dv_disco
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   TODO

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm25dv_disco
   :goals: debug
